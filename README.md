# DH 100 Portfolio
DH100 Theory and Method: The emphasis of this introductory digital humanities course is on the theoretical and methodological considerations involved with data-intensive research within the context of the humanities.

## Project Description
This project concentrates on analyzing the data obtained from the Gallup World Poll survey about life satisfaction. The datasets being used are called World Happiness Report from varying years (2005 - 2021). The purpose behind using these datasets is to explore the idea of how happiness can been affected by the changes from the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, I am comparing the years before versus after the pandemic. By using this data of different years, I will analyze the correlation and relation to life satisfaction to other factors such as life expectancy changes. The main goal of this project is supposed to bring more insight on how a pandemic changes the mental state of people and what affects it has on their overall outlook of life. 

## Methods and Tools for analysis
Used Kaggle as the tool to obtain the dataset. To do data analysis, I decided to use Jupyter Notebook as my means to work with the data and producing visualizations. 
The libraries being used for this project includes Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, and Seaborn. Pandas will be used to import the dataset (CSV file) to a dataframe. Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn are also used to produce visualizations. Numpy is used for data analysis with the data from the dataframe.
