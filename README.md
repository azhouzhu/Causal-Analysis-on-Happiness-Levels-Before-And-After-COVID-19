# DH 100 Portfolio
DH100 Theory and Method: The emphasis of this introductory digital humanities course is on the theoretical and methodological considerations involved with data-intensive research within the context of the humanities.

## Project Description
This project concentrates on analyzing the data obtained from the Gallup World Poll survey about life satisfaction. The datasets used within this project is part of the World Happiness Report from varying years (2005 - 2021). The purpose behind using these datasets is to explore the idea of how happiness can been affected by the changes from the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, I am comparing the years before versus after the pandemic. By using this data of different years, I will analyze the correlation and relation to life satisfaction to other factors such as life expectancy changes. The main goal of this project is supposed to bring more insight on how a pandemic changes the mental state of people and what affects it has on their overall outlook of life. 

## Dataset breakdown
The World Happiness Report relies on data collected from the Gallup World Poll surveys, an annual survey that started in 2005 and covers supposedly 99 per cent of the world’s population. In this project, I will be working with the datasets spanning from 2005 to 2021. 2021 is the most recent one with the happenings of COVID-19, while the previous years, 2005 to 2020 are before. The years 2005 to 2020 will be represented in the plots as the average of the values found across the years, unless indicated. 

Our main outcome is dependent on the comparison of the main life evaluation question asked in the poll, the so-called Cantril ladder (in the dataset it is represented as Ladder score). The basis of the Cantril ladder basically tells respondents to imagine themselves on a ladder with steps numbered from zero (the bottom) to ten (the top) where zero is the worst and ten being the best possible life. As one can tell, Cantril ladder is an evaluative measure of subjective well-being.

In addition to the Ladder score, there are six other factors to explain life evaluations. The columns demonstrate happiness scores through six factors: economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity. They have been deemed as variables of importance within research literature as it explains national-level differences in life evaluations.

Economic production column is self-explanatory, it is the log GDP per capita. Social support is based on the national average response (Yes = 1, No = 0) to the question: “If you were in trouble, do you have relatives or friends you can count on to help you whenever you need them, or not?”. Life expectancy is constructed based on data from the World Health Organization (WHO) and World Development Indicators (WDI).  Freedom is determined by the freedom to make life choices. It takes the national average of the binary responses to the question: “Are you satisfied or dissatisfied with your freedom to choose what you do with your life?”. Generosity is the residual of regressing the national average responses to the question “Have you donated money to a charity in the past month?” on GDP per capita. Perceptions of corruption are the average of binary answers to two questions: “Is corruption widespread throughout the government or not?” and “Is corruption widespread within businesses or not?” Where data for government corruption are missing, the perception of business corruption is used as the overall corruption-perception measure. 

Given that I have combined data from the years 2005 to 2021, it means the countries being included have been doing surveys each year. According to the World Happiness Report FAQ, this means the sample sizes for these countries are 3000 people. A sample size within the range of 2000 to 3000 can be used as a fairly good estimate at the national level. 

## Methods and Tools for analysis
Kaggle was used as the tool to obtain the dataset. Kaggle is an online crowd-sourced platform for data scientists to find and publish data sets, work with others, and to learn and explore predictive analytics problems.

To do the data analysis, I have decided to use Jupyter Notebook as my means of creating graphs through code. Jupyter Notebook is a server-client application that allows editing and running Notebook documents. The Notebook documents contain computer code (like Python) and rich text elements (such as paragraphs, equations, links, etc.). It can be executed locally (requiring no internet access) and it includes the packages I am going to use such as "pandas", "matplotlib", "numpy", and "seaborn". Pandas is used to import the dataset (CSV file) and for data analysis. Matplotlib and Seaborn are being used for graphing the necessary data charts. Numpy is for data manipulation and other miscellaneous usage.
